# Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Files in this repository:
- Project_Titanic.ipynb → Jupyter notebook containing data analysis & model building.
- train.csv → Dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Steps performed:
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training (e.g., Random Forest )
4. Accuracy evaluation


## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
